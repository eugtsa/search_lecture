## What is this?

This is the "Eat-them-all" game!

## Why do we need it?

This game is used to demonstrate different search algorithms in "AI crash course: Search" lecture.

## How to install game?

Run `make install` in your terminal (MacOS and Ubuntu based distros are supported):

```shell
make install
```

## How to play the game?

Run `make run` in bash console:

```shell
make run
```

There are 2 ways to play this game:

- use keyboard
- write computer program (agent) that will play this game

By default, the game will start in keyboard mode. Keyboard controls:

- arrow keys to move the pacman
- 'R' to restart the level
- 'N' to skip the level
- 'Q' to quit the game

Add the argument `agent` to the game start command to run your agent. For example:

```shell
make run agent=naive_random_walk_agent 
```

To start the game with your own custom agent put your agent to the ./agents folder. Agent module should be named in underscore notation (my_custom_agent) and agent class in it should be named the same but in camel case notation (MyCustomAgent)

To start the game without the gui, use `run_no_gui` for example:

```shell
make run_no_gui agent=better_random_walk_agent
``` 

### Game goal

Target of the game is to eat all dots and get maximum score in the end! All scores of completed levels will be summed up for the finish score.

### Game rules

Each pacman step will decrease the score by 1 credit. Each bump into the wall will not only stop pacman but also decrease the score by 3 credits. Each small dot eaten by pacman will increase score by 10 credits.

### How to write your own algorithm?

In order to write your algorithm you should create class which implements BaseAgent. Base Agent consists of one method, ``get_action``. Take a look at the naive_random_walk_agent.py:


```python
import random

from domain.action import Action
from domain.world import World
from domain.base_agent import BaseAgent


class NaiveRandomWalkAgent(BaseAgent):
    def get_action(self, world: World) -> Action:
        # taking random actions!
        return random.choice([Action.UP, Action.DOWN, Action.LEFT, Action.RIGHT])
``` 

As you can see, naive random walk agent does not take any information about the ``world`` variable at all! It just tryies to return some random action.

Here is another example, where you can see usage of the world information, random walk agent who is not bumping into the walls:


```python
import random

from domain.action import Action
from domain.world import World
from domain.base_agent import BaseAgent
from domain.point import Point


class RandomWalkAgent(BaseAgent):
    def get_action(self, world: World) -> Action:
        allowed_actions = list()

        cur_pos = world.cur_pos
        # let's not bump into walls to avoid -3 penalty
        if Point(cur_pos.x - 1, cur_pos.y) not in world.map.walls:
            allowed_actions.append(Action.LEFT)
        if Point(cur_pos.x + 1, cur_pos.y) not in world.map.walls:
            allowed_actions.append(Action.RIGHT)
        if Point(cur_pos.x, cur_pos.y - 1) not in world.map.walls:
            allowed_actions.append(Action.UP)
        if Point(cur_pos.x, cur_pos.y + 1) not in world.map.walls:
            allowed_actions.append(Action.DOWN)

        return random.choice(allowed_actions)
``` 

As you can see, this agent will first create the list of allowed actions and get random one from the list. 

### How to plug your algorithm (agent) into eat all dots game

CUrrently, only python is supported. If you want to support any other language to write your agent, please mail me - I'll extend this example to support other languages.

To plug your python agent into this game:

- Create new file with your python program (extention ``.py``) in the ``./agents`` folder
- Write your agent class based on the ``BaseAgent`` in this file (see examples above)
- Your agent class should implement ``get_action`` method (see examples above)
- Name of the class and name of the file should follow the rules:
    - names of the class and file should be semantically the same, but in different notations
    - name of the file should be in [snake_case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case) notation
    - name of the class should be in [camel_caps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) (``BumpyCaps``) notation


Check out examples of the last rule:

- ``my_agent.py`` file name -> ``MyAgent`` class name
- ``super_agent`` file name -> ``SuperAgent`` class name
- ``wtf_agent`` file name -> ``WtfAgent`` class name

To run your agent, plug it's file name without ``.py`` extention into any command with ``agent`` argument. For example:

- make run agent=my_agent
- make run_no_gui agent=super_agent

## What commands are supported?

- ``make run`` will run ``keyboard_agent by default
- ``make run`` command with ``agent=`` argument will run agent specified after equal sign with graphical user interface. To advance the agent to the next level you can either:
    - skip the level pressing ``n`` on the keyboard
    - wait until agent will finish the current level and then press any key on the keyboard
- ``make run_no_gui`` command with ``agent=`` argument will run agent specified after equal sign without graphical user interface
- ``make list_agents`` will list all possible agents currently available
- ``make install`` will install all dependencies (based in miniconda) into the local game folder
- ``make clean`` will remove all dependencies
