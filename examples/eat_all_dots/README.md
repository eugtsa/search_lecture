## What is this?

This is the "Eat-them-all" game!

## Why do we need it?

This game is used to demonstrate different search algorithms in "AI crash course: Search" lecture.

## How to install all dependencies?

Run `make install` in your terminal (MacOS and Ubuntu based distros are supported):

```shell
make install
```

## How to play the game?

Run `make run` in bash console:

```shell
make run
```

There are 2 ways to play this game:

- use keyboard
- write computer program (agent) that will play this game

By default, the game will start in keyboard mode. Keyboard controls:

- arrow keys to move the pacman
- 'R' to restart the level
- 'N' to skip the level
- 'Q' to quit the game

Add the argument `agent` to the game start command to run your agent. For example:

```shell
make run agent=naive_random_walk_agent 
```

To start the game with your own custom agent put your agent to the ./agents folder. Agent module should be named in underscore notation (my_custom_agent) and agent class in it should be named the same but in camel case notation (MyCustomAgent)

To start the game without the gui, use `run_no_gui` for example:

```shell
make run_no_gui agent=better_random_walk_agent
``` 

### Game goal

Target of the game is to eat all dots and get maximum score in the end! All scores of completed levels will be summed up for the finish score.

### Game rules

Each pacman step will decrease the score by 1 credit. Each bump into the wall will not only stop pacman but also decrease the score by 3 credits. Each small dot eaten by pacman will increase score by 10 credits.
